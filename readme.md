IS417 Data Science in the Humanities
====================================

Human culture provides an ideal testbed for students exploring data science--both because poems, stories, and songs highlight the challenges of high-dimensional unstructured, and because they're inherently fun to explore.

A semester of previous exposure to some programming language is a prerequisite for this course; the programming language you've used doesn't need to be Python, but you should be comfortable with concepts like "variable assignment" and "loops."

How to use this repository
--------------------------

For a complete syllabus, with a schedule of assignments and readings, see [the syllabus on GitHub pages,](https://tedunderwood.github.io/is417/) or ```syllabus.md.``` This readme file is just for quick orientation and initial setup.

Most aspects of the course will run through [the Moodle page](learn.illinois.edu); that's where you can connect to Zoom, upload assignments, and write forum posts.

But I'll also be distributing Jupyter notebooks and supporting data files. In most cases, it will be easiest to distribute those through GitHub.

So you might start by [installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Then open [a command line,](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/features/Command-Line/The-Command-Line.html) ```cd``` to a directory where you want to place ```is417/``` as a subfolder, and clone the repository by saying:

    git clone https://github.com/tedunderwood/is417.git

Later, when new materials have been added to this folder, you can get the materials by navigating to the ```is417``` folder and saying:

    git pull origin main

The files will automatically be placed in appropriate folders, which makes this a lot easier than downloading things from Moodle.
