    "# Implementing Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to walk through an implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier, and in doing so get comfortable with some basic aspects of machine learning on collections of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first week of this course we explored basic input and output using Python, and also reviewed some string operations that we can use to \"tokenize\" text (divide it into words or word-like tokens) and \"normalize\" it (for instance, by rendering everything lowercase). We could continue using those basic Python functions to convert the texts we use into numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since normalizing and tokenizing text is a very common operation, there are Python libraries that take care of it for us. Using them will simplify our code. Standard libraries also reduces sources of distortion that can creep into a model when (say) the model trained using one tokenizing process, and then applied to data produced with a different process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using CountVectorizer to turn texts into a pandas dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "One library we'll use a lot is [scikit-learn.](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html) As a package it's abbreviated ```sklearn.```\n"
